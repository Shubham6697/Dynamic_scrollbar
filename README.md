# Dynamic_scrollbar

### This is a dynamic scroll bar.
### This web page is mainly concern about to making a page wher we fetch an image data using API and create a dynamic image and then add the photos like Netflix website.
### I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScipt for making this, in other way we say that main work of this page is Javascript and CSS only.

#### I have hosted my webpage : https://ekmavivek-1729.github.io/Dynamic_scrollbar/
